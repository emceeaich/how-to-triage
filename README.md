How to start contributing to open source projects through issue triage

* Introduction
* Why triage?
  * Can be done without being a 'coder'
  * Popular projects have large backlogs of bugs which need attention
    * Angular 1,859 issues
    * Firefox 13,000 issues (bugs)
    * Node 500 issues
  * Providing clarity about a bug is as important as fixing a bug
* What's triage?
  * Getting a bug into a state where we know what the next step for is (Benjamin Smedberg)
  * Is this a bug or a feature request?
  * Is this a duplicate of another bug?
  * Can the bug be reproduced? 
* What triage isn't
  * Severity
  * Priority
  * Commitment
  * These are decided by project maintainers
* What makes a good bug?
  * What you were doing
    * Steps to reproduce
    * Version
    * Computer, phone (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android,â€¦)
  * What you expected
  * What you got instead
    * Description
    * Screenshots
  * Logs
* What makes a bug difficult to work with
  * No steps to reproduce
  * No information on which platforms or versions
  * Anger or maliciousness
    * This may not disqualifiy a bug
    * Some people are having a bad day
    * Some people are aiming to be jerks
